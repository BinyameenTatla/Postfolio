          Frontend development is the practice of building the visual and interactive components of a website or web application that users interact with directly. It involves using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, user-friendly designs and interfaces. Frontend developers work to ensure that a website looks good, is easy to use, and functions smoothly across different devices and browsers. They may also utilize frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.js to enhance functionality and efficiency in the development process.

  A landing page is a standalone web page designed with a specific focus, often created for marketing or advertising purposes. It serves as the entry point for visitors, guiding them toward a particular action, such as signing up, making a purchase, or downloading content. Typically, a landing page is optimized for conversions, featuring a clear call-to-action (CTA), compelling visuals, and concise, engaging copy. Itâ€™s often linked from ads, emails, or social media posts to drive traffic and achieve a specific goal..
